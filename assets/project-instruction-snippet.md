Add this to the repo-level instruction file used by your coding agent:

```md
## Daily Work Report

- After any meaningful completed task in this repo, use the installed `work-report-updater` skill before sending the final response.
- Treat finished implementation, bug fixes, documentation, setup, validation, and delivered support work as reportable by default.
- Skip report updates for discussion only, planning only, incomplete work, or failed attempts that did not produce a finished outcome.
- Keep the task summary short, simple, and written as completed work.
- Create or update the report in the repo root with the format `work-report-[mon-day-year]-[repo-name].md`.
- If `WORK_REPORT_HUB_API_KEY` is configured in the agent environment, let the skill sync the updated report to the hosted hub as well.
```
